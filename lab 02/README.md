# Lab 02 – Conditional Logic, Loops, Dictionaries, and NumPy

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to practice decision-making and data processing
using Python. This lab focused on conditional statements, loops, dictionaries,
and basic usage of the NumPy library for handling numerical data.

## Tasks Performed

### Task 01: Student Performance Analyzer
- Created a dictionary to store student names and their marks
- Used loops to calculate the class average
- Applied conditional statements to assign grades based on marks
- Identified the topper of the class
- Displayed individual grades for each student

### Task 02: Sensor Readings Validation Using NumPy
- Created a NumPy array to store sensor readings
- Identified valid and invalid readings based on a defined range (0–100)
- Calculated the average of valid readings
- Replaced invalid readings with the calculated average
- Counted the total number of invalid readings

## What I Learned
- How to use dictionaries for storing and processing structured data
- Application of conditional statements for grading logic
- Using loops to compute sums, averages, and maximum values
- Basics of NumPy arrays and their use in numerical computations
- Handling invalid data values in real-world-like scenarios

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- VS Code
