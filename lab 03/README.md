# Lab 03 – Data Analysis Using Pandas for Artificial Intelligence

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to practice data handling and analysis using the Pandas
library in Python, which is an essential step in Artificial Intelligence. This lab focused
on working with tabular data, performing calculations, filtering records, and
understanding basic data preprocessing techniques.

## Tasks Performed

### Task 01: Working with Pandas DataFrames
- Imported the Pandas library
- Created a DataFrame to store student-related data
- Accessed and displayed rows and columns from the DataFrame
- Performed basic operations on the dataset

### Task 02: Data Analysis and Filtering
- Calculated average values from the dataset
- Added new columns to the DataFrame
- Filtered student data based on given conditions
- Sorted data to analyze student performance

## What I Learned
- How to use the Pandas library for data analysis
- How to create and manipulate DataFrames
- How to filter, sort, and modify tabular data
- Understanding the importance of data preprocessing in Artificial Intelligence
- Using Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step data analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
