# Lab 01 – Introduction to Python for Artificial Intelligence

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to build a basic foundation in Python programming,
which is essential for understanding and implementing Artificial Intelligence concepts.
This lab focused on variables, data types, and basic data structures used in Python.

## Tasks Performed

### Task 01: Variables and Data Types
- Declared variables to store personal information such as name, age, and height
- Used basic data types like string, integer, and float
- Performed arithmetic operations
- Updated variable values and displayed results

### Task 02: Data Structures (List, Tuple, Set)
- Created and manipulated lists, tuples, and sets
- Added elements to a list and a set
- Accessed elements from a tuple using indexing
- Converted a list to a set to remove duplicate values
- Converted a set back to a list

### Task 03: Student Marks Processing
- Stored student marks using list, tuple, and set
- Calculated total and average marks using a loop
- Checked the existence of a value in a tuple
- Added a new value to a set
- Displayed data from all data structures

## What I Learned
- How to declare and update variables in Python
- Understanding and usage of basic data types
- Differences between list, tuple, and set
- How sets automatically remove duplicate values
- How to use loops for calculations
- Importance of Python data structures for AI problem-solving
