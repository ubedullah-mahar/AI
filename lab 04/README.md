# Lab 04 – Data Cleaning and Inspection Using Pandas for Artificial Intelligence

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand and practice **data cleaning and inspection**
techniques using the Pandas library in Python. Since real-world datasets are often
incomplete and inconsistent, this lab focused on handling missing values, removing
duplicate data, and inspecting datasets before analysis, which is a crucial step in
Artificial Intelligence workflows.

## Tasks Performed

### Task 01: Dirty Data Cleanup
- Loaded a real-world styled dataset using Pandas
- Identified missing values in the dataset
- Removed low-quality rows using the `thresh` parameter
- Replaced missing values with a fixed numerical value
- Detected and removed duplicate records to improve data quality

### Task 02: Data Inspection and Slicing
- Displayed the first few rows of the dataset to inspect formatting
- Displayed the last row of the dataset for validation
- Extracted specific columns to create a smaller DataFrame
- Ensured correct DataFrame structure during column selection

## What I Learned
- How to handle missing values in a dataset using Pandas
- How to filter low-quality data using non-missing value thresholds
- The importance of removing duplicate data before analysis
- How to inspect datasets using slicing techniques
- How data cleaning improves the reliability of AI models
- Understanding how Pandas handles missing data internally
- Working efficiently with Jupyter Lab for data preprocessing
